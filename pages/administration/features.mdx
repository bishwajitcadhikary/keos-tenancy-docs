# Features

If you want to limit software usage to a specific set of features, you can use the `features` parameter. The software will only be usable if the plan contains all the features in the `features` parameter.

### Step 1: Create a feature
    * Go to the `Software` tab and create a software.
    * Come back to the `Features` tab and click on `+` icon to create a new feature.
    * Fill in the form and click on `Save`.

    For example, we have created a feature called `product-limit` with a value of `50` in the [Plans](/administration/plans) section.

### Step 2: Limit software usage to a specific set of features
    * Open your software script in your favorite code editor.

    **Laravel:**
    For example, we have a `Product` model and a `ProductController` to create a product. We have to limit the product creation based on the product-limit feature.
    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use App\Models\Product;
    use App\Models\Saas\Feature;
    use App\Http\Requests\StoreProductRequest;
    use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

    class ProductController extends Controller
    {
        // ...other methods
        public function store(StoreProductRequest $request)
        {
            // We have to limit the product creation based on the product-limit feature.
            $feature = Feature::whereSlug('product-limit')->first();

            if ($feature->hasAccess()) {
                // Check if the exceded the product limit
                if (Product::count() < $feature->value) {
                    $product = Product::create($request->validated());

                    return redirect()->route('products.index')->with('success', 'Product created successfully.');
                } else {
                    return redirect()->route('products.index')->with('error', 'You have exceeded the product limit.');
                }
            } else {
                return redirect()->route('products.index')->with('error', 'You do not have access to create a product.');
            }
        }

        // ...other methods
    }
    ```
